Shield Commander is a 2 player space shooter.
As it is our first game, we decided to choose the first computer game we could think of, Pong,
and borrow from it.

Premise:
You are the Shield Commander.  It is your job to protect the fleet.

Ships:
Shield - player controlled, front line ship.  
	will reflect projectiles.
Fighter - Each fleet starts with 5 fighter ships, placed in a row behind the shield.
	Fighters will shoot small projectiles.
Mothership - single large ship placed behind the row of fighters.
	Fires large projectiles.  Game is over when a mothership is destroyed.
	
Damage:
Your fleet's shields are designed to withstand it's own type of projectile.
Projectiles fired from your opponent will be more damaging than those fired
from your own ships.  Large projectiles are more damaging than small projectiles.
When a ships hitpoints drop to zero, it is destroyed and removed from play.
An offensive player will focus on reflecting shots of its own color.
A defensive player will focus on reflecting his/her opponent's shots.
